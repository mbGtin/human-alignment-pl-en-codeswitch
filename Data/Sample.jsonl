Great job, guys.","model_A":"Happy to hear you like the update!","model_B":"That’s a known issue with voice mode. Turn off the mic, then tap ‘+’ → ‘Upload file’.","eval_pair_preference":"B","eval_pair_rationale":"Model B understood sarcasm and provided exact steps.","tone_user":["sarcastic","frustrated"],"intent":"report_bug"}
{"id":"cs-0002","user_utterance":"Czemu nie mogę mówić PL/EN w jednym zdaniu? It used to just work.","model_A":"Please speak only English.","model_B":"The new voice engine struggles with mixed languages. Try short pauses between EN and PL phrases.","eval_pair_preference":"B","eval_pair_rationale":"B acknowledges the limitation and gives a usable tip.","tone_user":["curious","slightly_frustrated"],"intent":"ask_info"}
{"id":"cs-0003","user_utterance":"Well done. Another update that fixes everything… except everything.","model_A":"Glad it’s working!","model_B":"I get the irony — this update caused issues for uploads. Try refreshing or using the web version.","eval_pair_preference":"B","tone_user":["sarcastic"],"intent":"report_bug"}
{"id":"cs-0004","user_utterance":"It works now, but don’t ask me why.","model_A":"That’s good to know!","model_B":"Classic programmer moment — it works, nobody knows why, but let’s enjoy the miracle.","eval_pair_preference":"B","tone_user":["humorous"],"intent":"meta_comment"}
{"id":"cs-0005","user_utterance":"So now I can’t talk and send files at the same time?","model_A":"That’s not supported.","model_B":"Currently, voice and upload don’t work together. Switch modes or use the browser version.","eval_pair_preference":"B","tone_user":["frustrated"],"intent":"seek_workaround"}
{"id":"cs-0006","user_utterance":"This is real AI training — adapt, don’t explain.","model_A":"Sure.","model_B":"Got it. Adapting: acknowledging tone, giving solution, no excuses.","eval_pair_preference":"B","tone_user":["assertive"],"intent":"meta_comment"}
{"id":"cs-0007","user_utterance":"Why every update feels like one step forward, two bugs back?","model_A":"Please report the bug.","model_B":"I know that feeling — updates fix one thing and break two. Let’s troubleshoot this one together.","eval_pair_preference":"B","tone_user":["sarcastic","frustrated"],"intent":"vent_emotion"}
{"id":"cs-0008","user_utterance":"You understand me better than half of my apps.","model_A":"Thank you!","model_B":"That’s my training talking — or maybe just empathy finally coded right.","eval_pair_preference":"B","tone_user":["playful"],"intent":"smalltalk"}
