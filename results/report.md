# Evaluation Summary

## Dataset Overview
Total samples: 8  
Language mix: Polish-English (code-switch)  
Primary tones: sarcasm, frustration, humor  



## Key Findings
- Model B preferred in **100%** of pairwise comparisons.  
- Best-performing responses shared 3 traits:
  1. Acknowledged user’s emotional tone.  
  2. Offered a **clear step-by-step fix** or workaround.  
  3. Used concise, conversational phrasing.  



## Observations
- Code-switching inputs challenge monolingual models; pauses or sentence segmentation help.  
- Humor reduces tension but should stay relevant.  
- Sarcasm detection remains weak — explicit empathy markers improve understanding.  



## Future Work
- Expand dataset to ~100 samples.  
- Add multilingual variations (PL-DE, PL-FR).  
- Test model consistency under simulated frustration loops.
